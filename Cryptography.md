# Encryption
## Wi-Fi Encryption
* **Purpose:** To scramble data so it is unreadable to anyone who is not a legitimate participant on the network. 
* **How it works:** Uses algorithms to transform data into a secret code. Only devices with the correct encryption keys can decrypt and read the information. 
* **Examples:**
**AES (Advanced Encryption System):** A strong encryption standard used in WPA2 and WPA3 to protect data confidentiality. 
**WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** An older, now-vulnerable standard that uses static keys and is no longer recommended due to its weak security. 

# Authentication
## Wi-Fi Authentication
* **Purpose:** To ensure that only authorized users and devices are permitted to join the Wi-Fi network. 
* **How it works:** Typically involves a password or network key that users must provide to connect to the network. More advanced methods, like those in WPA2-Enterprise, use unique user identifiers for enhanced security. 
* **Examples:**
**WPA/WPA2/WPA3-Personal:** Users enter a pre-shared password to access the network. 
**WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise:** Uses RADIUS servers and digital certificates to provide more robust, unique authentication for each user, common in business environments. 

# Hashing
Distinct cryptographic hash functions, not encryption algorithms, that produce a unique fixed-size "fingerprint" of data, called a hash or digest.
* MD5
* SHA
