CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT
-
The Linux kernel ring buffer, also known as the kernel log buffer, stores messages generated by the kernel. These messages are typically viewed using the `dmesg` command.

The size of this ring buffer is determined by the `CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT` kernel configuration option. This value represents the power of 2 that defines the buffer's size in bytes. For example, if `CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT` is 18, the buffer size is 2^18 bytes, or 256 KiB.
